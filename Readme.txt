INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN THE CODE:
1. Libraries and modules used - cv2, numpy, math ,heapq
2. Run the code and it will ask for user input for start coordinate and goal coordinate.
   The format for the coordinates is x,y (i.e Enter two numbers seperated by comma)
   For example in the video generated,
         start coordinate = (6,6)
         goal coordinate = (400,200)
   Note: The origin is in the bottom left corner and the maximum dimention for x = 1200 and y = 500
3. The terminal will display the total cost and the path followed to reach the goal
4. Visualize the animation by opening the "dijkstra_harshavarthan_varatharajan.mp4"
   created in the same directory as the code.
